This file can be generated with the <code>--depth-of-coverage</code>/<code>-doc</code> flag, the output will be provided in TSV format.</p> <p>Example: <pre><code>trueconsense \\\n    --input input.bam \\\n    --reference reference.fasta \\\n    --features reference-features.gff \\\n    --samplename example \\\n    --output test_output/example_cov_ge_30.fa \\\n    --coverage-level 30 \\\n    --depth-of-coverage example_coverage.tsv \n</code></pre></p> Generating a VCF-file <p>TrueConsense can generate a VCF file matching the given coverage-threshold that matches the generated consensus-sequence. With this, you can easily generate the various VCF-files in case a downstream analysis requires VCF input. Or if you wish to share data with other researchers but it's not possible to share (large)Fasta files.</p> <p>The VCF-output can be generated with the <code>--variants</code>/<code>-vcf</code> flag, this flag corresponds to an output directory and not a single file. The generated files follow the same naming structure as the normal consensus-sequences.</p> <p>Example: <pre><code>trueconsense \\\n    --input input.bam \\\n    --reference reference.fasta \\\n    --features reference-features.gff \\\n    --samplename example \\\n    --output test_output/example_cov_ge_30.fa \\\n    --coverage-level 30 \\\n    --variants vcf_output/example_cov_ge_30.vcf\n</code></pre></p> Generating updated GFF files <p>TrueConsense keeps track of the open reading frames given in the input-gff and determines new stop-positions and/or new start-positions when applicable for every open reading frame in the input. This is done to make sure the generated consensus-sequence is possible when it comes to virus-biology.  </p> <p>The updated GFF-files can be generated with the <code>--output-gff</code>/<code>-ogff</code> flag, this flag corresponds to an output directory and not a single file. The generated files follow the same naming structure as the normal consensus-sequences.</p> <p>Example: <pre><code>trueconsense \\\n    --input input.bam \\\n    --reference reference.fasta \\\n    --features reference-features.gff \\\n    --samplename example \\\n    --output test_output/example_cov_ge_30.fa \\\n    --coverage-level 30 \\\n    --output-gff gff_output/example_cov_ge_30.gff\n</code></pre></p> <p>TrueConsense calls IUPAC nucleotide ambiguity-codes by default when an aligned-position has an even (or near-even) split of nucleotides. This can be turned off by providing the <code>--noambiguity</code>/<code>-noambig</code> flag. Please note that this will cause TrueConsense to choose the most prominent nucleotide on a split-position, if the split is exactly even on such a position then a random choice will be made between the two (or three) possibilities.</p>"},{"location":"user-guide/#limitations","title":"Limitations","text":"<p>TrueConsense only works with alignments in BAM-format as an input. Other inputs such as SAM or CRAM are currently not supported.</p> <p>Additionally, the generated VCF-files are formatted in a way that they can be used to accurately reconstruct the consensus-sequence when sharing the VCF files with other researchers/institutes/etc with a tool such as <code>bcftools consensus</code>. That also means that these VCF-files may not always follow the specifications for VCF-files, for example when ambiguity nucleotides are present in the VCF-file. The generated VCF-files are made in a way that a tool such as <code>bcftools</code> can use it, but these VCF-files may not always work in other tools such as IGV.</p> <p>TrueConsense can only compensate for common alignment artefacts to a certain degree and does so based on the index that TrueConsense makes which contains a distribution of  \"nucleotide events\" per column of the alignment. There are some edge-cases where the alignment cannot be done without introducing an artefact which cannot be compensated by TrueConsense as information will not be included by the aligner on certain positions. In this case, the index on these positions can be overwritten with an index made in an earlier stage of analysis. This can be done with the <code>--index-override</code> flag, the data must be provided as a compressed CSV (.csv.gz) file. Below is an example of the necessary format, where \"X\" is deletions and \"I\" is number of reads with an insertion. The first column (position) has no header.  </p> coverage A T C G X I 1 1 2 7 3 5 1 3 2 1 2 3 4 10 0 0 <p>Please only use this when absolutely necessary</p> <p>Using the index override may solve a very specific issue for you particular analysis, but it will also cause the result to be much harder to validate. Additionally, this may introduce new issues as there is little to no validation of the override-data which will be handled as \"truthful\" data.</p>"}]}
